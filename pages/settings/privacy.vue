		<text class="text-option u-m-t-30">Mall transaction mode</text><br data-v-4d774a5e="">
		<text class="text-option u-m-t-30"> There are two ways to buy in the mall, one is full purchase, and the other is
			deposit purchase. </text>
		<text class="text-option u-m-t-30"> In the mode of full purchase, you can place an order directly and purchase goods
			in full payment. </text>
		<text class="text-option u-m-t-30"> The deposit purchase mode will freeze the customer's deposit, and the customer
			will take delivery after completing the final payment within 7 days. Users who have paid a deposit will be given an
			extra point quiz game. According to the analysis of market fluctuations, they have the opportunity to win more
			points to deduct the payment or send red envelopes to friends. </text>
		<text class="text-option u-m-t-30"> The pre-order model has many benefits for customers. The deposit not only
			generates an order for the customer, but also gives the customer an equal amount of red envelopes, which can be
			withdrawn immediately. Although the deposit is not refundable, the red envelope converted from the deposit can be
			withdrawn without any loss to the customer. </text>
		<text class="text-option u-m-t-30"> 1. After the customer pays the deposit and orders, a merchandise order is
			generated, and the mall began to prepare this order. This deposit cannot be returned. After the customer needs to
			make up the balance, the mall will ship the goods. If the customer does not make up the balance, the product order
			will always exist. </text>
		<text class="text-option u-m-t-30"> 2. After paying the deposit, the customer will be given a red envelope account
			with the same amount of deposit. </text>
		<text class="text-option u-m-t-30"> 1. The red envelope can be withdrawn directly, so that instead of losing money,
			the customer has added a commodity order generated by a deposit. And red envelopes can also be given to friends.
		</text>
		<text class="text-option u-m-t-30"> 2. If the customer uses the red envelope account to participate in the game, you
			can earn more red envelopes, but if the game loses, the red envelope will be gone, but his merchandise order is
			still there. </text>
